The C++ code in the following assignments are from an object-oriented programming course I took at Florida State University.
Some of the topics covered during these included multiple inheritance, dynamic memory allocation, OOP, and polymorphism to name a few.
Each assignment includes multiple files that should run when all are included in the g++ command in the files directory in the UNIX command line.
